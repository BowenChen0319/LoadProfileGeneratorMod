	abstract = {Flexible household devices, such as heat pumps combined with thermal energy storage or battery energy storage units, can provide flexibility to the electricity sector. However, to make flexibility available to the market, it has to be correctly quantified, and its cost has to be estimated. In this work, a methodology for generic flexibility quantification is proposed and developed in a Python environment using model predictive control. The chosen methodology allows to quantify the adjustable power, and also to determine the corresponding cost of the flexibility provision. It was observed that the available flexibility and its cost is influenced by many factors such as system components, human behavior, building thermal parameters, and price signals. Also, the inclusion of even a low share of households with batteries or electric vehicles smoothens the aggregated flexibility profile, and a considerable amount of flexibility is available at almost any point in time.},

	abstract = {HyFlow is a grid-based multi-energy system (MES) modelling framework. It aims to model the status quo of current energy systems, future scenarios with a high share of fluctuating energy sources or additional consumers like electric vehicles, and to compare solution strategies if certain parts of the infrastructure are congested. In order to evaluate the congestion limits and the feasibility and suitability of solution strategies (e.g., energy storage, sector coupling technologies, demand response (DR)), load flow calculations of all three main grid-bound energy carriers are implemented in one single modelling framework. In addition to the implemented load flow models, it allows the interaction of these grids with the use of hybrid elements. This measure enables a proper assessment of future scenarios, not only for the infrastructure of one energy carrier, but for the overall energy system. The calculation workflow of HyFlow, including the implemented load flow calculations, as well as the implementation of the flexibility options, is described in detail in the methodology section. To demonstrate the wide range of applicability of HyFlow with different spatial ranges, two case studies referring to current research problems are presented: a city and a region surrounding the mentioned city. The calculations for the mentioned case studies are performed for three levels. A \&ldquo;status quo\&rdquo; level, a \&ldquo;high-stress\&rdquo; level with added fluctuating energy sources and consumers, and an \&ldquo;improvement\&rdquo; level, where flexibility options are introduced to the system. The effect of the flexibility options on future energy grids is, therefore, analyzed and evaluated. A wide variety of evaluation criteria can be selected. For example, the maximum load of certain power lines, the self-sufficiency of the overall system, the total transport losses or the total energy consumption.},

	abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) is becoming one of the most significant renewable sources for positive energy district (PED) in Sweden. The lack of innovative business models and financing mechanisms are the main constraints for PV\&rsquo;s deployment installed in local communities. This paper therefore proposes a peer-to-peer (P2P) business model for 48 individual building prosumers with PV installed in a Swedish community. It considers energy use behaviour, electricity/financial flows, ownerships and trading rules in a local electricity market. Different local electricity markets are designed and studied using agent-based modelling technique, with different energy demands, cost\&ndash;benefit schemes and financial hypotheses for an optimal evaluation. This paper provides an early insight into a vast research space, i.e., the operation of an energy system through the constrained interaction of its constituting agents. The agents (48 households) show varying abilities in exploiting the common PV resource, as they achieve very heterogeneous self-sufficiency levels (from ca. 15\% to 30\%). The lack of demand side management suggests that social and lifestyle differences generate huge impacts on the ability to be self-sufficient with a shared, limited PV resource. Despite the differences in self-sufficiency, the sheer energy amount obtained from the shared PV correlates mainly with annual cumulative demand.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel method of sizing PV storage systems for different household types such as single -, family –shared flats – or pensioner households. The method is based on a simulation model that characterizes the PV system including peripheral components like the inverter and the battery. The required input data to carry out the calculations is gathered from simulated household loads, characteristics of system components and measured radiation values. Sizing the grid-connected PV storage system is performed based on technical parameters only, without economic evaluation. The results show significant differences in the ideal system configuration depending on the household types ranging from a PV to battery ratio of 0.76–4.25 kWpeak/kWh. This suggests, that the household type needs to be considered before installing a PV storage system in order to ensure optimal results for the customer and the energy system. After the technical sizing, the results are compared to economic design optima, in order to investigate existing differences.},

This simulation runs through 2 million scenarios based on actual probabilities to incorporate most possible situations. It also includes samples from normally distributed household electricity use scenarios based on agent-based modeling. The article includes the test grid parameters for simulation, which were used to create a benchmark grid in DigSilent Powerfactory software, as well as intermediate outputs defining worst case scenarios when electric vehicles were charged and results from three different optimization approaches involving a reduction in voltage drops, cable overloading and total line losses. The outputs from the benchmark grid were used to train a machine learning algorithm, the weights and codes for which are also attached. This trained network acted as the grid for subsequent iterative optimization procedures. Outputs are presented as a comparison between pre-optimization and post-optimization scenarios. The above dataset and procedure were repeated while varying the number of EVs between 0 and 100 in increments of 20, data for which are also attached.

	abstract = {An investigation of a distributed and integrated system of a trigeneration with a 
hybrid energy storage unit and an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) has been conducted 
using experimental tests and modelling simulation. A detail background study and 
literature review was carried out which covered the related studies of the similar 
trigeneration systems. 
 The design of the whole system was displayed, the operation mode was 
formulated and the control strategy was proposed for meeting the dynamic power 
demand of selected case studies. Detailed simulation models for the integrated system 
were developed. The models were validated using experimental test results and the 
accuracy of the models were guaranteed (within 1.81\%). The integrated model was 
then used to evaluate the overall performance of the system and the results showed 
that this system could meet the dynamic demand of the households. The system’s 
overall efficiency was 48.3\% and 52.2\% in two case studies. A further study on the 
optimal operation of the system was carried out, and it is found that the integrated 
system’s efficiency was improved from 3\% to 22\%. 
It was found that the integrated system of a trigeneration with a hybrid energy storage 
unit and an ORC has the potential advantage over the conventional trigeneration in 
terms of overall energy efficiency and operational flexibility. The main challenge lies 
within the area of operation control of such an integrated system and further research 
into this control issue is needed. Future study into exploring other renewable energy 
sources for the system and more experimental tests on the integrated system are 
suggested},

These systems are subject to an inter-play of shading and self-consumption issues such that it makes sense to determine the functional capacity and positioning for the system before to simulate it. This study analyzes the effectiveness of one optimization approach and matches it against traditional dimensioning methods. Three design methods are described and compared to an ideal design: the minimum capacity required by the current Italian law, the PV capacity whose annual cumulative production equals the cumulative demand of the building and an optimization technique using a constant energy demand. The methods were all tested on a residential building located in Firenze (Italy). The case study is currently undergoing energy refurbishment for experimental purposes within H2020 EnergyMatching project. The results show that the optimization approach outperforms the other methods despite the simplified input data. The optimization method, even when fed simplified data, still leads to an improvement of NPV (Net Present Value) up to +85\% compared to the other methods and can achieve {\textgreater}93\% of the actual optimum. In countries where net billing (or net metering) incentives are still in place the optimization technique is not so vital.},
