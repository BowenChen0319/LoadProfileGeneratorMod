                Request for help:<LineBreak />
                Please help improve the LPG by increasing the data basis. <LineBreak />

                Two things would help a lot: <LineBreak />
                First, if you have measured device profiles (doesn't really matter which devices), please consider donating some to the LPG.
                <LineBreak />
                Second, it would be helpful to have behaviour data about more households. So if you have time, please consider if it would be possible to keep track of all the actions in your household for a few days in
                a 15 min resolution.
                <LineBreak />
                Also, if you send me such data, I'll model your household for you. All behaviour data will be anonymized of course and all donated device profiles will be properly attributed.

                </>

                The Load Profile Generator enables you to generate load profiles for households.
                You can either use one of the predefined households, define your own by using the
                predefined building blocks for the household or start by defining your own. More and
                detailed information is available in the manual that you can request from the author.
                The reason for not delivering the manual with the LPG is
                that I'm curious who is using the LPG and what people are doing with it.
                <LineBreak />
                <LineBreak />
                If you are looking for the quickest way to a load profile, select &quot;Calculation&quot; on the left,
                fill in a target path and click on the button &quot;calculate!&quot;.
                <LineBreak />
                <LineBreak />
                Else you can either edit the existing elements by selecting them in the tree on the right or add new
                ones by selecting &quot;Add&quot; in the menu above.
                <LineBreak />
                <LineBreak />
                If you want to make changes, the way the program works is roughly like this: Persons will select based
                on their Desires from the Affordances in a Household what to do. Which affordances are available
                depends on the devices in the Household. Each Device use causes a certain energy use based on the
                Load Type and the Time Profile. So to start with a new Household, add some Persons, set the Desires
                for the Persons and then add a Household. Add as many Devices to the Household as you want so that
                the Persons have enough to do. Then run the simulation. Additionally you can add new Devices and
                put them together into new Affordances.
